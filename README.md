# Homebrew Python Scripting

This repository contains two Python scripts, `analytics.py` and `sort.py`, that analyze the most downloaded packages on Homebrew. This README will guide you through the steps taken to create these scripts, explaining their functionality and how to use them.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the most popular packages on Homebrew by analyzing download statistics. The scripts are designed to be simple yet effective, allowing users to easily understand and modify them as needed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required packages using:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Script Overview

### analytics.py

The `analytics.py` script is responsible for fetching and analyzing download data from Homebrew. Here are the steps taken to create this script:

1. **Data Collection**: The script uses the Homebrew API to fetch download statistics for various packages.
2. **Data Processing**: It processes the fetched data to extract relevant information, such as package names and their download counts.
3. **Data Analysis**: The script performs analysis to identify trends and insights, such as the most downloaded packages over a specific period.
4. **Output**: Finally, it outputs the analysis results in a user-friendly format, such as a CSV file or a printed summary.

### sort.py

The `sort.py` script is designed to sort the data generated by `analytics.py`. Here's how it was developed:

1. **Input Handling**: The script takes the output file from `analytics.py` as input.
2. **Sorting Logic**: It implements sorting algorithms to arrange the packages based on their download counts, either in ascending or descending order.
3. **Output Generation**: The sorted data is then saved to a new file, making it easy for users to view the most popular packages.

## Usage

To run the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/homebrew-python-scripting.git
   cd homebrew-python-scripting
   ```

2. Run `analytics.py` to fetch and analyze the download data:

   ```bash
   python analytics.py
   ```

3. After running `analytics.py`, execute `sort.py` to sort the results:

   ```bash
   python sort.py
   ```

4. Check the output files for the analysis and sorted data.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a practical example of using Python for data analysis and sorting. Feel free to modify the scripts to suit your needs or to enhance their functionality. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
